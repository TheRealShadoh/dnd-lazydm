Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\n\n**Targeted Effects.** Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\n\n**Areas of Magic.** The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\n**Spells.** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\n**Magic Items.** The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n\n**Magical Travel.** Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n\n**Creatures and Objects.** A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\n\n**Dispel Magic.** Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

On a failure, the creature uses its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target, and is unwilling to move away from the target.  \nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect. An affected creature can also make a saving throw once every 24 hours while within the area of the spell, and whenever it ends its turn more than 60 feet from the target and is unable to see the target.",

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions.

This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.",

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to. and then contingency ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\n**Flood.** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts\n\n **Part Water.** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\n**Redirect Flow.** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\n**Whirlpool.** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

The doorway must be at least 1 foot wide by 2 feet tall and can be no larger than 5 feet wide by 10 feet tall. Once the door is drawn, place the knob appropriately; it attaches magically to the surface and your drawing becomes a real door to the spell's destination. The doorway remains functional for the spell's duration. During that time, anyone can open or close the door and pass through it in either direction.\n  The destination can be on any plane of existence. It must be familiar to you, and your level of familiarity with it determines the accuracy of the spell (determined by the GM). If it's a place you've visited, you can expect 100 percent accuracy. If it's been described to you by someone who was there, you might arrive in the wrong room or even the wrong structure, depending on how detailed their description was. If you've only heard about the destination third-hand, you may end up in a similar structure that's in a very different locale.\n  *Door of the far traveler* doesn't create a doorway at the destination. It connects to an existing, working door. It can't, for example, take you to an open field or a forest with no structures (unless someone built a doorframe with a door in that spot for this specific purpose!). While the spell is in effect, the pre-existing doorway connects only to the area you occupied while casting the spell. If you connected to an existing doorway between a home's parlor and library, for example, and your door leads into the library, then people can still walk through that doorway from the parlor into the library normally. Anyone trying to go the other direction, however, arrives wherever you came from instead of in the parlor.\n  Before casting the spell, you must spend one hour etching magical symbols onto the doorknob that will serve as the spell's material component to attune it to your desired destination. Once prepared, the knob remains attuned to that destination until it's used or you spend another hour attuning it to a different location.\n  *The door of the far traveler* is dispelled if you remove the knob from the door. You can do this as a bonus action from either side of the door, provided it's shut. If the spell's duration expires naturally, the knob falls to the ground on whichever side of the door you're on. Once the spell ends, the knob loses its attunement to any location and another hour must be spent attuning it before it can be used again.",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature. Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.",

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area. When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area. A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. This spell can't be dispelled by dispel magic.",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\n**Explosive Runes.** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-­foot-­radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n**Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\n\n**Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\n\n**Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\n\n**Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\n\n**Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\n**Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\n\n**Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

Nothing can enter the tomb. No teleportation or planar travel can be used to enter, leave, or affect the tomb or its contents. A small mithral orb is required for this casting.\n* **Chaining:** Chains made of unbreakable material erupt from the ground and root the target in place. The target is restrained and cannot be moved by any means. A small adamantine chain is required for this casting.\n* **Hedged Prison:** The target is imprisoned in a maze-like demiplane of your choosing, such as a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, a hedge maze, or any similar structure you desire.

The special component for this effect is whatever prison you wish to use.\n* **Slumber:** The target is plunged into an unbreakable slumber and cannot be awoken.

If targeting an organization or a kingdom, the incantation requires an object epitomizing the entity as part of the material component, such as a crown, mayoral seal, standard, or primary relic. If targeting a person, the primary performer must hold a vial of the person's blood. Over the course of the incantation, the components are mixed and the primary caster inscribes a false history and a sum of knowledge concerning the target into the book using the mockingbird quills. When the incantation is completed, whatever the caster wrote in the book becomes known and accepted as truth by the target. The target can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to negate this effect. If the target was a city or a kingdom, the saving throw is made with advantage by its current leader or ruler. If the saving throw fails, all citizens or members of the target organization or kingdom believe the account written in the book to be fact. Any information contrary to what was written in the book is forgotten within an hour, but individuals who make a sustained study of such information can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to retain the contradictory knowledge. Books containing contradictory information are considered obsolete or purposely misleading. Permanent structures such as statues of heroes who've been written out of existence are believed to be purely artistic endeavors or so old that no one remembers their identities anymore. The effects of this ritual can be reversed by washing the written words from the book using universal solvent and then burning the book to ashes in a magical fire. Incantation of lies made truth is intended to be a villainous motivator in a campaign, with the player characters fighting to uncover the truth and reverse the spell's effect. The GM should take care not to remove too much player agency with this ritual. The creatures affected should be predominantly NPCs, with PCs and even select NPCs able to resist it.

All creatures in that line and up to 100 feet above it take 2d8 thunder damage plus 2d8 piercing damage; a successful Dexterity saving throw negates the piercing damage. A creature that fails the saving throw is impaled by a chunk of crystal that halves the creature's speed, prevents it from flying, and causes it to fall to the ground if it was flying. To remove a crystal, the creature or an ally within 5 feet of it must use an action and make a successful DC 13 Strength check.

A creature that’s in the area when the spell is cast, or that begins its turn in the area or enters it during its turn, takes 10d6 fire damage and must make a Strength or Dexterity (creature’s choice) saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the molten arms, which try to drag it below the surface of the ash.\n\nA creature that’s restrained by the arms at the start of your turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet farther down into the ash. A creature pulled below the surface is blinded, deafened, and can’t breathe. To escape, a creature must use an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature is no longer restrained and can move through the difficult terrain of the ash pit. It doesn’t need to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw this turn to not be grabbed by the arms again, but it must make the saving throw as normal if it’s still in the ash pit at the start of its next turn.\n\nThe diameter of the ash pit increases by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. The ash pit remains after the spell ends, but the grasping arms disappear and restrained creatures are freed automatically. As the ash slowly cools, it deals 1d6 less fire damage for each hour that passes after the spell ends.",

You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can move through the doorway into the realm beyond. For the spell's duration, the mirror remains anchored in the plane of origin, where it can't be broken or otherwise damaged by any mundane means. No creatures other than those you designate can pass through the mirror or see into the mirror realm.\n  The realm within the mirror is an exact reflection of the location you left. The temperature is comfortable, and any environmental threats (lava, poisonous gas, or similar) are inert, harmless facsimiles of the real thing. Likewise, magic items reflected in the mirror realm have no magical properties, but those carried into it work normally. Food, drink, and other beneficial items within the mirror realm (reflections of originals in the real world) function as normal, real items; food can be eaten, wine can be drunk, and so on. Only items that were reflected in the mirror at the moment the spell was cast exist inside the mirror realm. Items placed in front of the mirror afterward don't appear in the mirror realm, and creatures never do unless they are allowed in by you. Items found in the mirror realm dissolve into nothingness when they leave it, but the effects of food and drink remain.\n  Sound passes through the mirror in both directions. Creatures in the mirror realm can see what's happening in the world, but creatures in the world see only what the mirror reflects. Objects can cross the mirror boundary only while worn or carried by a creature, and spells can't cross it at all. You can't stand in the mirror realm and shoot arrows or cast spells at targets in the world or vice versa.\n  The boundaries of the mirror realm are the same as the room or location in the plane of origin, but the mirror realm can't exceed 50,000 square feet (for simplicity, imagine 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on a side). If the original space is larger than this, such as an open field or a forest, the boundary is demarcated with an impenetrable, gray fog.\n  Any creature still inside the mirror realm when the spell ends is expelled through the mirror into the nearest empty space.\n  If this spell is cast in the same spot every day for a year, it becomes permanent. Once permanent, the mirror can't be moved or destroyed through mundane means. You can allow new creatures into the mirror realm (and disallow previous creatures) by recasting the spell within range of the permanent mirror. Casting the spell elsewhere doesn't affect the creation or the existence of a permanent mirror realm; a determined spellcaster could have multiple permanent mirror realms to use as storage spaces, hiding spots, and spy vantages.",

The portion of your plane that's inside the bubble swaps places with a corresponding portion of the plane your music box is attuned with. There is a 10% chance that the portion of the plane you summon arrives with native creatures on it. Inanimate objects and non-ambulatory life (like trees) are cut off at the edge of the bubble, while living creatures that don't fit inside the bubble are shunted outside of it before the swap occurs. Otherwise, creatures from both planes that are caught inside the bubble are sent along with their chunk of reality to the other plane for the duration of the spell unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast; with a successful save, a creature can choose whether to shift planes with the bubble or leap outside of it a moment before the shift occurs. Any natural reaction between the two planes occurs normally (fire spreads, water flows, etc.) while energy (such as necrotic energy) leaks slowly across the edge of the sphere (no more than a foot or two per hour). Otherwise, creatures and effects can move freely across the boundary of the sphere; for the duration of the spell, it becomes a part of its new location to the fullest extent possible, given the natures of the two planes.

If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice). When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

The ray’s effect and the saving throw that applies to it depend on which color is dominant when the beam strikes its target, determined by rolling a d8.\n\n| d8 | Color | Effect | Saving Throw |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Red | 8d10 fire damage | Dexterity |\n| 2 | Orange | 8d10 acid damage | Dexterity |\n| 3 | Yellow | 8d10 lightning damage | Dexterity |\n| 4 | Green | Target Poisoned | Constitution |\n| 5 | Blue | Target Deafened | Constitution |\n| 6 | Indigo | Target Frightened | Wisdom |\n| 7 | Violet | Target Stunned | Constitution |\n| 8 | Shifting Ray | Target Blinded | Constitution |\n\nA target takes half as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw. A successful Constitution or Wisdom saving throw negates the effect of a ray that inflicts a condition on the target; on a failed save, the target is affected for 5 rounds or until the effect is negated. If the result of your attack roll is a critical hit, you can choose the color of the beam that hits the target, but the attack does not deal additional damage.",

It must then make a wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded.

    "description": "A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted. The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below. The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n\n**1. Red.** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n\n**2. Orange.** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\n\n**3. Yellow.** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n\n**4. Green.** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n\n**5. Blue.** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n\n**6. Indigo.** On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n\n**7. Violet.** On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.",
