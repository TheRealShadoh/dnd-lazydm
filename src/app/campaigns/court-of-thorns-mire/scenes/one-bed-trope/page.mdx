# Scene 1: The One Bed Trope

> **Scene Type:** Roleplay & Tension
> **Active Mechanics:** Relationship Track, Inspiration for Roleplay

You cross the **Iron Bridge** and night quickly falls, bringing a deep, unnatural cold that even Seraphine's furs can't completely ward off. She leads you to a crumbling, partially protected hunting shack.

## Perception Check

Make a <DiceNotation value="DC 13" /> Survival or Perception check.

- **Success:** You notice frost patterns forming unnaturally fast - Fae magic is strong here
- **Failure:** The cold seems normal for this harsh land

## The Shelter

Seraphine sets her pack down heavily, pulls out a single, large bedroll, and spreads it near the fire pit. There is only space for one person.

She looks at the bedroll, then at you, a flicker of challenge in her eyes.

> *"I will take the first watch. Sleep. We press on before dawn."*

**A choice must be made:** Who gets the bedroll, and how does your PC handle the close quarters and the cold?
