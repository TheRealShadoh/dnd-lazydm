# Aftermath: The Choice of the Heart (Romantic Climax)

> **Active Mechanics:** [Relationship Track](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#1-the-relationship-track-hidden-dm-score) (determines ending), [Inspiration for Roleplay](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#3-inspiration-for-roleplay)

The Attor is slain, its body dissolving into black smoke that whispers only one name before vanishing: **"Amarantha."**

Elara, the Baron's daughter, is safe. Seraphine, though injured, is alive. She bandages her arm, her movements tight with adrenaline.

She looks at you, her rivalry momentarily stripped away, replaced by the intensity of shared survival.

> "You... fought well," she admits, the words tasting strange on her tongue. She looks down, then back up, meeting your eyes, which now hold a newfound depth of understanding. "It was the bond, wasn't it? The magic of the place. It's dangerous, that feeling. It means something—something you can't walk away from."

**Your PC must make a choice that determines the relationship's future:**

1. **The Forbidden Touch (Sensual):** Step closer and wipe the grime/blood from her cheek with your thumb. *("It means everything, Seraphine. We face it together.")*

2. **The Tactical Retreat (Suggestive):** Step back and focus on the mission. *("Let's just get the girl home, Ranger. We can talk about magic and destiny when we're not bleeding.")*

3. **The Grand Gesture (Plot Hook):** Announce that the Attor's final word, "Amarantha," must be investigated. *("The gold means nothing. This goes deeper. You and I are going to find out who Amarantha is.")*

## The Session Ends

- **If you chose (1) - The Forbidden Touch:** You find yourselves back-to-back again, but this time, it is by choice. You are no longer just allies. The political world is closing in, but so is your bond.

- **If you chose (2) - The Tactical Retreat:** The tension remains, a dangerous coil, ready to spring. Seraphine nods curtly, accepting the boundary, but her eyes linger a moment too long.

- **If you chose (3) - The Grand Gesture:** Seraphine's eyes widen, then narrow with determination. "Amarantha... I know that name from Court whispers. If you're serious about this hunt, then yes. We go together." The political intrigue deepens, and so does your partnership.
