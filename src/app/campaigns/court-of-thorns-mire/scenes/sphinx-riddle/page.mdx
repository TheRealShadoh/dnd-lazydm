# Scene 3.5: The Whisper of the Sphinx (Riddle & Roleplay)

> **Active Mechanics:** [Relationship Track](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#1-the-relationship-track-hidden-dm-score), [Inspiration for Roleplay](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#3-inspiration-for-roleplay)

**(Placement: After Scene 3, before Scene 4)**

The path through the ruined watchtower narrows to a single, tight passage, a bottleneck leading to the central chamber. The air here is unnaturally cold, heavy with ancient, humming magic. Seraphine is wiping Mire-Naga venom from her dagger with a grimace, her nerves clearly frayed.

Suddenly, a shimmer appears in the air ahead, coalescing into a translucent, feminine figure whose body ends in a serpent's coil, its face a mask of cold, stunning beauty. This is a **Minor Sphinx-Fae**, a silent guardian left behind by one of the higher courts. It is not here to fight, but to test.

It speaks, its voice a soft, dry whisper that seems to slide directly into your mind:

**"To pass, you must understand the deepest magic that binds this world and the mortal heart. Resolve the paradox that tethers all who wear mortal flesh and desire the magic of Prythian."**

The Sphinx-Fae presents the riddle, its translucent eyes fixed on you:

## The Riddle

> *"There are those who seek me a lifetime but never we meet,*
> *And those I kiss but who trample me beneath ungrateful feet.*
> *At times I seem to favor the clever and the fair,*
> *But I bless all those who are brave enough to dare.*
> *By large, my ministrations are soft-handed and sweet,*
> *But scorned, I become a difficult beast to defeat.*
> *For though each of my strikes lands a powerful blow,*
> *When I kill, I do it slow…"*
>
> **What am I?**

## Roleplay & Tension

This is a critical point for character development. The PC and Seraphine must work together under immense pressure, with the subject of the riddle applying emotional weight.

- **Action:** The PC or Seraphine can attempt a <DiceNotation value="DC 15" /> Intelligence (Investigation) check or <DiceNotation value="DC 17" /> Wisdom (Insight) check to discern the emotional core of the riddle and narrow down the possibilities.

- **Seraphine's Intervention:** If the PC is struggling, Seraphine meets the PC's eyes, her own filled with a mixture of fear and desperation. She whispers, *"It's about the thing that drove me from my post... the thing that makes us forget duty. Be brave enough to say the truth."* This powerful hint should guide the PC toward the correct answer.

## Solution

The answer is **LOVE**.

## Consequences

### Success (Correct Answer: LOVE)

The Sphinx-Fae smiles—a cold, beautiful, and deeply knowing expression—and dissolves into a mist of silvery sparks. The path is clear.

**Romantic Consequence:** The act of saying the word in front of Seraphine, under duress, creates immediate, palpable tension.

**Relationship Track Updates:**
- **Seraphine's Attraction Score increases by +2**

Award Inspiration for the courage to speak the truth.

### Failure (Three Incorrect Guesses)

The Sphinx-Fae does not fight. Instead, it places a temporary curse, mirroring the nature of the riddle. For the duration of the upcoming **Attor** fight, all party members receive **Disadvantage on Attack Rolls** against the target of the **Attor's Rend** attack, as their hearts are momentarily distracted by conflicting emotions.

**Additional Consequence:**
- If the PC fails three times and **blames Seraphine**, her **Trust Score decreases by -2**

## The Transition

The Sphinx-Fae dissolves, but the sense of relief is immediately annihilated. A chilling, powerful shriek echoes from the ruined tower's center chamber just ahead, louder and closer than before. You feel the magic of the riddle settling over you, a new, heavy truth. You know instantly that you are standing on the precipice of the final confrontation.
