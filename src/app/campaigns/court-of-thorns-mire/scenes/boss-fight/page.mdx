# Scene 4: The Beast and the Bond (Climax & Boss Fight)

> **Active Mechanics:** ALL THREE - [Relationship Track](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#1-the-relationship-track-hidden-dm-score), [Nascent Fae Bond](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#2-the-nascent-fae-bond-mechanical-integration) (ACTIVATES!), [Inspiration for Roleplay](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#3-inspiration-for-roleplay)

The last Bogge falls with a whimper. A chilling, powerful shriek echoes from the ruined tower's center chamber. You enter a large, open area. The **Attor** stands over a cowering young woman—Elara.

The creature turns to face you. It is winged, grotesque, and possesses a pair of eyes that seem to absorb the light.

**The Attor** (CR 5) - (See [Monster Reference](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/monsters#the-attor-cr-5))

**The Attor speaks, its voice a mental thunder:** **"MORTAL WHELP. YOU WILL SERVE. OR YOU WILL FALL."**

The fight begins.

## The Developing Bond: Nascent Fae Bond Activation

Mid-way through the fight, the intensity of the moment triggers a *minor, nascent Fae Bond* between the PC and Seraphine. The magic of the Fae Wastelands forces this connection regardless of the PC's human status.

**The Trigger:** The Attor uses its **Telepathic Screech** (Recharge ability). The psychic pain is overwhelming.

> *Seraphine lets out a ragged cry of pain, clutching her head. Her eyes find yours—wide, terrified, and utterly defenseless.*

### Romantasy Mechanics: Bond Activation

**Nascent Fae Bond Benefits** (Once Activated):

1. **Shared Resilience (Protective Instinct):** The PC automatically gains **Advantage** on the saving throw against the **Telepathic Screech** because their protective focus on Seraphine overrides the raw psychic attack.

2. **Shared Surge (Bonus Action):** For the remainder of combat, the PC can use a **Bonus Action** on their turn to grant Seraphine **Advantage** on her next attack roll, or vice versa. This represents a minor telepathic surge of protective energy and focus between the bonded pair.

3. **Vulnerability:** The Attor gains **Advantage** on attack rolls against Seraphine if the PC is **Frightened** or **Restrained**, and vice versa. The Bond creates a magical link, making them vulnerable to each other's emotional state.
