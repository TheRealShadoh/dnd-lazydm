# Scene 3: The Mire Ambush (Combat)

> **Active Mechanics:** [Relationship Track](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#1-the-relationship-track-hidden-dm-score), [Inspiration for Roleplay](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/mechanics#3-inspiration-for-roleplay)

**"You chose poorly, mortals."**

The ward vanishes, and the air immediately darkens. You hear a sickly, wet shuffling sound from the shadows of the ruins. Three figures emerge: small, hunched, and dripping with foul water. These are **Bogge**—low-ranking, feral Fae.

## The Battlefield

The ruins are surrounded by murky water and twisted roots. The bogge emerge from multiple directions, using the terrain to their advantage.

> **Enemies:** 3 x **Bogge** (See [Monster Reference](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/monsters#bogge-cr-14))

## Battle Chemistry

During the fight, one of the **Bogge** uses its **Whispering Fear** on the PC, causing them to flinch or momentarily freeze. Seraphine, seeing the danger, instantly throws herself in front of the PC, deflecting a *Bogge's* claw strike with her own blade.

> *Seraphine snarls, pressing her back against yours.* "Focus, dammit! Don't you dare die before I collect the bounty." *Her breath is hot against the back of your neck. You feel the strength of her shoulder pressed against you as you fight back-to-back.*
