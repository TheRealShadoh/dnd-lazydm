The next morning, Seraphine leads you to the ruins of an ancient Fae watchtower, where the Attor is rumored to nest. A shimmering, barely visible wall of emerald energy—a simple Fae ward—blocks the main entrance.

## The Ruins Layout

**Seraphine says:** "A simple protection spell, likely placed by one of the Attor's masters, or perhaps its Fae prisoner. It repels living flesh. We cannot just walk through."

## The Puzzle: The Fae Ward

The ward is powered by three stone pillars nearby, each carved with the image of a different Fae Court symbol:

1. **A Thorned Rose** (Spring Court)
2. **A Star** (Night Court)
3. **A Skull** (Autumn Court)

Each pillar is cracked, and wisps of the emerald energy are flowing from the cracks to the main ward. To break the ward, the flow must be disrupted *at the same moment*.

- **Action 1: Disrupting the Flow.** A creature must succeed on a <DiceNotation value="DC 15" /> Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check or a <DiceNotation value="DC 14" /> Wisdom (Survival) check to precisely stuff the cracks with mud and special herbs Seraphine provides. A failure results in a minor <DiceNotation value="1d10" /> force damage backlash.

- **Action 2: The Court of Choice.** While two PCs (or a PC and Seraphine) are attempting to disrupt the flow, the third must use a piece of metal (a knife, a coin) to trace one of the Court symbols on the central lintel of the archway. The symbol must be chosen based on which Court is *least* likely to want to protect a winged horror.
  - **Success (Correct Choice: Night Court/Skull):** The emerald ward shivers, and the air around the pillars cracks. The ward is gone.
  - **Failure (Incorrect Choice):** The ward flashes brightly. The team must succeed on a <DiceNotation value="DC 12" /> Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the end of their next turn.

## Optional Encounter: The Suriel's Interrogation (RP/Non-Combat)

**When to Use:** After solving the ward puzzle, or during a short rest before entering the ruins.

While approaching the ruins or taking a brief rest, the party stumbles upon a clearing marked by an ancient, tangled knot of briars and thorns. A figure sits motionless at the center: **the Suriel**—a creature shrouded in ancient, fragile lace and shadows, its face obscured.

It is bound by a curse that forces it to answer any truth spoken to it.

### The Encounter

The Suriel will not fight or harm the party unless they attempt to free it or attack it. It speaks with an ancient, high voice.

**The party may ask ONE question:**

**Sample Questions:**

1. **"Suriel, what is the fastest way to save Elara from the Attor?"**
   - The Suriel gives a clear but cryptic answer about the wards, the Attor's weakness, or a hidden passage.

2. **"Suriel, what does Seraphine truly desire?"**
   - The Suriel reveals a stark truth: *"She desires freedom from the chains of her failure, and perhaps... the warmth of a trust she thought forever lost."*
   - **Seraphine's Reaction:** She glares at the PC, her jaw tight. She may snap: "Keep your eyes on the mission, not on reading my soul."
   - **Romantic Impact:** Attraction +1, Trust -1 (she's unnerved but drawn to the truth)
   - Award Inspiration for thematic RP about revealing emotional truths

3. **"Suriel, what does [PC Name] truly desire?"**
   - The Suriel reveals the PC's hidden desire—power, escape, redemption, or perhaps affection for Seraphine.
   - **Seraphine's Reaction:** Depends on the answer. If romantic, she looks away, conflicted.
   - **Romantic Impact:** Varies based on answer. If romantic desire revealed: Attraction +1, Trust -1

> **See:** [The Suriel (Monster Reference)](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/reference/monsters#the-suriel-the-bound-weaver-of-truths)

**Goal:** This encounter advances the plot or reveals deep emotional truths, building narrative and romantic stakes.
