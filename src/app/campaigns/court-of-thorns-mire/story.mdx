## Prologue: The White Wolf and the Reckoning (Inciting Incident)

The air is bitter, the kind of deep cold that promises no mercy. Snow-laden branches creak above, and the forest floor is a patchwork of pale snow and dark, frozen earth. You haven&apos;t had a good kill in days, and hunger is a sharp, cold knife in your gut.

  <h4 className="font-bold">Skill Check: <DiceNotation value="DC 13" /> Wisdom (Survival or Perception)</h4>
  <p className="mt-2">On a success, you notice <strong>footprints that are too large</strong> for a typical wolf, and they cut off abruptly—as if the creature materialized from the air.</p>
</div>

Suddenly, you hear a low, rumbling growl, and a flash of white movement catches your eye. Standing thirty feet away, motionless and utterly silent, is a wolf. But this is no common beast. It is massive—easily the size of a small pony—with thick white fur that seems to radiate cold. Its eyes are a startling, unnatural gold, fixed on you with an intelligence that is deeply unsettling. It carries itself with a regal stillness, and a hunter&apos;s instinct screams that this is something *dangerous*.

**The Choice:**

This is the largest prey you&apos;ve seen all winter, enough to feed your group for a week. But there is something in those eyes that whispers of consequence.

**What do you do? Do you raise your weapon and attempt the kill, or do you stand down?**

      <p><strong>If the party attempts to kill the wolf:</strong> The PC must make a <strong><DiceNotation value="DC 15" /> Attack Roll</strong>.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-1 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Success:</strong> The creature lets out a silent, pained sound. The moment it dies, it melts into a shapeless, viscous mound of glistening black ichor that quickly soaks into the snow. The scent of ozone and lilac suddenly fills the air.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure:</strong> The wolf vanishes into the trees with impossible speed, leaving no sound or track.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>If the party stands down:</strong> The wolf holds its gaze for a long moment, then slowly, deliberately, turns and melts silently into the shadows, leaving behind only the unnerving scent of lilacs.</p>

### Inciting Incident and The Rival

No sooner has the moment passed than the forest erupts with panic.

A frantic, out-of-breath runner bursts from the path you just cleared, stumbling through the snow. He delivers a summons from **Baron Alaric**, who lives on the forest&apos;s edge. His daughter, Elara, has been stolen—a huge, winged creature called an **Attor** appeared in their home just moments ago and vanished with her toward the Iron Bridge.

The messenger leads you back to the Baron&apos;s meager keep. There, waiting impatiently by the hearth, is your contact and unwilling guide: **Seraphine**, a disgraced former Royal Ranger. She&apos;s tall, whip-smart, and moves with a coiled intensity that only battle can unleash. She is the **Rival** archetype.

She holds a map, already marked with the path to the Fae-claimed *Wastelands*.

> "The creature took the girl as soon as your little hunting party scattered its distraction," Seraphine states, her dark eyes pinning the PC responsible for the wolf encounter. Her lip curls in disdain. "Amateur hour is over. I am here to ensure that Baron Alaric gets his daughter back, and that you do not start a war with Prythian in the process."
>
> "I know the creature&apos;s nest—an old Fae watchtower beyond the Iron Bridge. We leave now. We will move fast, and we will not be gentle."
