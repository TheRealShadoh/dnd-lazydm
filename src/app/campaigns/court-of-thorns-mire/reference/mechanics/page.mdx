# Romantasy Mechanics for The Court of Thorns and Mire

This one-shot employs several unique mechanics designed to seamlessly blend the emotional stakes of romantasy with the tactical rules of D&D 5e.

This system relies on three core mechanics: **Relationship Tracks**, **The Nascent Fae Bond**, and **Inspiration for Roleplay**.

---

## 1. The Relationship Track (Hidden DM Score)

The DM maintains a simple, hidden score for the PC's relationship with the NPC Rival, **Seraphine**. This track determines the availability of certain emotional and mechanical advantages.

### Core Scores Tracked

| Score | Description | Initial Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attraction/Intimacy** | Measures romantic tension and physical/emotional pull. | **0** |
| **Trust/Guardedness** | Measures willingness to rely on the PC and drop the 'Rival' façade. | **+1** (She respects your presence) |

### How to Modify the Scores

| Action | Score Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Leaning into Tension (The One Bed Scene)** | **Attraction +1** |
| **Making a Selfless Choice for Her** | **Trust +1, Attraction +1** |
| **Displaying Combat Prowess (Protecting her)** | **Trust +1** |
| **Displaying Weakness/Flinching** | **Trust -1** |
| **Revealing an Emotional Truth (The Suriel)** | **Attraction +1, Trust -1** (She's unnerved but drawn to the truth) |

### Relationship Thresholds (NPC Response)

- **Attraction Score of +2 or higher:** Seraphine is more likely to accept proximity and return charged dialogue. Triggers the **Battle Chemistry** mechanical advantage.
- **Trust Score of +3 or higher:** Seraphine will openly share her political fears or backstory, unlocking key information.
- **Trust Score of -1 or lower:** Seraphine may actively work against the PC's non-essential choices or refuse to fight alongside them, hindering the use of certain Bonds.

## 2. The Nascent Fae Bond (Mechanical Integration)

This mechanic is designed to link the characters mechanically to reflect the magical, high-stakes nature of the world. It is triggered by shared moments of intense emotional or physical peril, regardless of the PC's human status—the magic of the Fae Wastelands forces the connection.

### Triggers

The Bond is triggered during the **Climax (Scene 4)**, specifically when the **Attor** uses its powerful **Telepathic Screech**. This intense, shared moment of pain for Seraphine forces the latent magic to connect the two characters.

### Mechanical Benefits/Effects (Once Activated)

1. **Shared Resilience (Protective Instinct):** The PC automatically gains **Advantage** on the saving throw against the **Telepathic Screech** because their protective focus on Seraphine overrides the raw psychic attack.

2. **Shared Surge (Bonus Action):** For the remainder of the combat, the PC can use a **Bonus Action** on their turn to grant Seraphine **Advantage** on her next attack roll, or vice versa. This represents a minor telepathic surge of protective energy and focus between the bonded pair.

3. **Vulnerability:** The DM may choose to give the **Attor** (or future Fae enemies) **Advantage** on attack rolls against Seraphine if the PC is **Frightened** or **Restrained**, and vice versa. The Bond creates a magical link, making the characters vulnerable to each other's emotional state.

## 3. Inspiration for Roleplay

This mechanic encourages players to prioritize romantic and character-driven choices over purely optimal tactical decisions, leaning into the "Romantasy-Forward" tone.

### When to Award Inspiration

- **Leaning into Tension:** Using charged dialogue, physical proximity, or making a flirtatious/challenging choice in a high-stakes moment (e.g., during the **One Bed Trope**).
- **Character Sacrifice:** Choosing an action that benefits Seraphine's emotional arc or safety over the party's general tactical advantage.
- **Thematic RP:** Verbally expressing the character's internal conflict regarding Seraphine, duty, or the strange magic of the Fae.
- **Grand Gestures (Climax):** Choosing Option 1 (The Forbidden Touch) or Option 3 (The Grand Gesture) at the end of the one-shot.

## DM Tips for Using These Mechanics

1. **Keep the Scores Hidden:** Don't reveal exact numbers to the players. Describe Seraphine's reactions and body language instead.

2. **Balance Mechanics with Roleplay:** The scores guide NPC behavior, but roleplay should feel natural, not robotic.

3. **Respect Player Agency:** If a player isn't interested in the romance, don't force it. The mechanics should enhance willing participation.

4. **Adjust Difficulty:** If the party is struggling in combat, the Bond benefits can provide tactical relief while maintaining narrative weight.

5. **Use Inspiration Generously:** Reward players for leaning into the romantasy tone, even if their choices aren't mechanically optimal.
