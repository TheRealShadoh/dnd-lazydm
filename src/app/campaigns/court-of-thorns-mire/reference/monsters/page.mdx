## Minor Sphinx-Fae (Non-Combat Encounter)

*Medium Fey, Lawful Neutral*

The Minor Sphinx-Fae is a translucent, feminine figure whose body ends in a serpent's coil. Its face is a mask of cold, stunning beauty. A silent guardian left behind by one of the higher Fae courts, it does not fight but instead tests those who wish to pass with riddles.

**Encounter Notes:**

- The Sphinx-Fae appears as a shimmering translucent guardian blocking a critical passage.
- It speaks directly into the minds of those present with a soft, dry whisper.
- The riddle must be answered correctly to pass. The Sphinx-Fae allows **three guesses**.
- It does not fight, but failure results in a curse affecting the upcoming combat.

**The Riddle:** See [Scene 3.5: The Whisper of the Sphinx](/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/scenes/sphinx-riddle) for the full riddle and consequences.

**Romantic Tension:** The answer to the riddle is deeply personal and creates significant emotional weight when spoken aloud in Seraphine's presence.

## The Suriel - The Bound Weaver of Truths

<ImageLightbox
  src="/campaigns/court-of-thorns-mire/img/suriel.jpg"
  alt="The Suriel"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

The Suriel is a powerful, ancient Fey creature bound by magical compulsion. While primarily intended as a high-stakes **roleplay encounter**, its power level demands that if the Level 4 party chooses to attack it (a choice that should be heavily discouraged by the DM), it becomes a significant and highly dangerous foe.

### Roleplay Encounter (Recommended)

*Glimpsed Fey, Neutral*

The Suriel is an ancient, truth-telling entity bound by a curse that forces it to answer any truth spoken to it. It appears as a figure shrouded in fragile lace and shadows, face obscured, sitting motionless at the center of a clearing marked by tangled briars and thorns.

**Encounter Notes:**

- The Suriel will not fight or harm the party unless they attempt to free it or attack it.
- It speaks with an ancient, high voice and can be asked **one question** by the party.
- Sample questions and answers:
  - "What is the fastest way to save Elara from the Attor?" - The Suriel gives a cryptic answer about the wards or the Attor's weakness.
  - "What does [character name] truly desire?" - The Suriel reveals a stark truth about hidden desires for power, escape, or affection.

**Romantic Tension:** If the question reveals romantic feelings, Seraphine's reaction depends on what is revealed. Her Attraction Score may increase by +1, but her Trust may decrease temporarily, complicating the relationship.
