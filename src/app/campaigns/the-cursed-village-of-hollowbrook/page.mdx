# The Cursed Village of Hollowbrook

The party arrives in the once-idyllic village of Hollowbrook, now plagued by a mysterious curse. Children have been disappearing, and the villagers live in constant fear. The source of the curse is a malevolent spirit Dweller in the Shadows, who has taken residence in an abandoned mill. The party must unravel the mystery, confront the spirit, and lift the curse before the village is lost forever. Along the way, they'll encounter terrified villagers, eerie omens, and a forgotten history that binds the spirit to the land.
