# The Frozen Forest

> *The wind howls through the skeletal trees, their branches heavy with ice. The ground crunches beneath your boots, a thin layer of snow concealing jagged rocks and hidden pits. The air is so cold it burns your lungs, and the silence is broken only by the occasional distant screech of a bird. You can't shake the feeling that you're being watched.*
