# The Frozen Lake

> *The frozen lake stretches out before you, its surface a patchwork of ice and snow. The wind whips across the expanse, carrying with it the distant howls of unseen creatures. The ice groans and cracks beneath your feet, and you can't help but feel that it's only a matter of time before it gives way. In the distance, the silhouette of a massive figure looms—a guardian of the lake, or perhaps a predator waiting for its next meal.*

The party must cross a treacherous frozen lake to escape the Goblerkin or reach Gorm the Frost Giant's lair. The lake is home to ice wyrms and other dangers.

## Objectives

- Cross the frozen lake safely and reach the other side.
- Avoid or defeat the dangers lurking beneath the ice.
- Decide whether to confront Gorm the Frost Giant or search for another path.

## DM Secrets

- The frozen lake is home to an ancient, slumbering ice wyrm that the Goblerkin and Gorm both fear.
