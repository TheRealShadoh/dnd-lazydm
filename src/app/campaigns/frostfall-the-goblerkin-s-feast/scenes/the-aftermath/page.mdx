# The Aftermath

> *The warmth of the tavern is a stark contrast to the frozen wilderness you've just escaped. The flickering fire casts long shadows on the walls, and the low hum of conversation is a welcome change from the eerie silence of the forest. The patrons eye you with a mix of curiosity and fear, whispering about the tales of the Goblerkin's hut and the missing hunters. The local lord approaches you, his expression a mix of relief and concern. 'You've returned,' he says, 'but the question is, what did you bring back with you?'*

The party returns to civilization, where they must deal with the consequences of their actions and the truth behind the disappearances.

## Objectives

- Report their findings to the local authorities.
- Decide what to do with any survivors or captured Goblerkin.
- Determine the fate of the Glacialveil forest and its inhabitants.

## NPCs

### Local Lord
**Role:** Authority figure and potential patron

He will demand answers and may offer further quests based on the party's findings.

### Survivors
**Role:** Potential allies or accusers

Their reactions will depend on the party's actions and the truth about the disappearances.

## Encounters

### Interrogation by the Authorities
**Difficulty:** easy

The party is questioned by the local lord and his advisors, who demand to know the truth behind the disappearances.

### Confrontation with the Survivors
**Difficulty:** medium

If the party brought back any survivors, they must deal with the aftermath of their ordeal and the truth about the Goblerkin.


## Treasure
