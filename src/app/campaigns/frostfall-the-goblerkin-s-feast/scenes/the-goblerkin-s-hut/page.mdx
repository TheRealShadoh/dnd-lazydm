# The Goblerkin's Hut

> *Before you stands a hut like no other—a grotesque amalgamation of stolen armor, enchanted feathers, and twisted wood. The structure seems to breathe, its walls shifting and groaning as if alive. A low, rhythmic chanting drifts from within, accompanied by the clatter of plates and the sizzle of cooking meat. The air is thick with the scent of roasting fowl, and a warm, orange glow spills from the cracks in the walls. You can't help but feel a mix of curiosity and dread.*

The party arrives at the Goblerkin's fortified hut, a bizarre structure made of stolen armor and enchanted feathers. They must navigate the complex social dynamics of the Goblerkin and uncover the truth behind the disappearances.
