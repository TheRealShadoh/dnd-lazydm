# The Escape

> *The wind howls through the skeletal trees, their branches heavy with ice. The ground crunches beneath your boots, a thin layer of snow concealing jagged rocks and hidden pits. The air is so cold it burns your lungs, and the silence is broken only by the occasional distant screech of a bird. You can't shake the feeling that you're being watched. The blizzard is closing in, and you must escape the forest before it's too late.*

The party must escape the Glacialveil forest before the blizzard traps them forever. They must navigate the treacherous terrain and avoid the dangers that stalk the forest.

## Objectives

- Navigate the frozen forest and reach the edge of the blizzard.
- Avoid or defeat the predators that stalk the forest.
- Decide whether to take any survivors with them or leave them behind.

She will try to help the party if they prove themselves trustworthy, but she is afraid of Magda's wrath.
