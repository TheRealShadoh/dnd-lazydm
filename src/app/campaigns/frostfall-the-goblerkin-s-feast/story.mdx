# Frostfall: The Goblerkin's Feast

Deep in the heart of the frostbitten forest of Glacialveil, the players stumble upon a peculiar settlement where a secretive clan of turkey-people, the Goblerkin, have built a fortified hut from stolen armor and enchanted feathers. The players must navigate treacherous terrain, battle frost giants and magical turkey-men, and uncover the truth behind the disappearances of local hunters. Along the way, they'll deal with the Goblerkin's unpredictable hospitality and the looming threat of a blizzard that could trap them forever. The campaign culminates in a desperate battle against the Goblerkin's matriarch, who seeks to expand her domain and ensnare the party in her eternal feast.
