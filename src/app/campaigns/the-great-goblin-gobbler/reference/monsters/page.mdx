**Challenge** 5

### Traits

***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and is not in sunlight or exposed to fire.

***Turkey Lust.*** The troll has advantage on attacks against creatures wearing or carrying turkey feathers or carrying live turkeys.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The troll makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a turkey or is wearing turkey feathers, the troll has advantage on the attack roll.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a turkey or is carrying a live turkey, the troll has advantage on the attack roll and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be grabbed (escape DC 13). The troll can only have one target grabbed at a time.

***Turkey Call.*** The troll lets out a loud, gobbled call. Each creature of the troll's choice within 30 feet that is carrying or wearing a turkey must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. The charmed creature is friendly to the troll and can't take actions against it. Another creature can also use an action to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the troll's Wisdom (Animal Handling) check (+3) to break the effect on a charmed turkey.
