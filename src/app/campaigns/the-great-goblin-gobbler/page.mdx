# The Great Goblin Gobbler

The small village of Harvest's End is in a panic. The annual Thanksgiving feast is ruined when a gang of goblins steals all their prized turkeys. Worse yet, a terrifying monster has been stalking the forest, and the goblins seem to be working for it. The party is hired to retrieve the stolen turkeys, put an end to the goblins, and uncover the mystery of the forest beast. Along the way, they'll encounter strange goblin inventions, a chatty forest spirit, and a very hungry troll with a taste for poultry. This one-shot combines lighthearted humor with exciting combat and creative problem-solving.
