# The Stolen Feast

> *The village of Harvest's End should be bustling with preparations for the annual Thanksgiving feast, but instead there's chaos in the streets. Villagers mill about, shouting about missing turkeys, ruined recipes, and strange goblin tracks in the forest. The scent of half-baked pies hangs in the air, mingling with the smell of fear and irritation. Mayor Thaddeus Brannon stands on the steps of the town hall, adjusting his hat nervously as he tries to maintain order.*

The party arrives in Harvest's End to find the village in chaos. Turkeys are missing, the feast is ruined, and goblins are to blame. The mayor and villagers beg for help.
