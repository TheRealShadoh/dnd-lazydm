# The Goblin Trail

> *The forest is quiet, too quiet. The only sounds are the occasional cracking of a twig underfoot or the distant caw of a crow. The goblins' tracks lead deeper into the woods, and as you follow them, you notice strange, crude devices set up along the path - tripwires, swinging logs, and even what looks like a rudimentary catapult filled with... is that rainbow-colored pudding?*

The party follows the goblin tracks into the forest, encountering strange traps and devices along the way.

## Objectives

- Follow the goblin trail into the forest
- Disarm or avoid the various traps
- Find the goblin camp and the stolen turkeys
