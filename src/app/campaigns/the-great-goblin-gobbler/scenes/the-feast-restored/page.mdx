# The Feast Restored

> *The village of Harvest's End is alive with celebration. Villagers dance in the streets, music fills the air, and the scent of roasting turkey is everywhere. The town square is transformed into a grand feast, with long tables laden with food and drink. Mayor Thaddeus Brannon stands proudly, his hat finally staying put, as he welcomes the party as honored guests. Old Man Jenkins tends to his rescued turkeys, and Priestess Elara Moonwhisper smiles knowingly, as if she knew this would all work out.*
