# The Goblin Camp

> *The goblin camp is a chaotic mess of lean-tos, stolen goods, and half-eaten meals. Crates of stolen turkeys sit in the center of the camp, guarded by a few goblins. The air smells of smoke and unwashed bodies. In the distance, you hear the occasional growl of something large and hungry. The goblins seem nervous, glancing at the woods and whispering amongst themselves.*
