# The Forest Beast

> *The forest grows darker and more oppressive as you follow the trail of large, muddy footprints. The trees seem to lean in, their branches forming a twisted canopy overhead. A foul stench fills the air - rotting meat, wet fur, and something else, something... feathery. Suddenly, you hear a loud, wet CRUNCH, followed by a satisfied belch. Something is eating. And it's close.*

The party follows the clues to confront the mysterious beast that the goblins were working for - a massive, turkey-obsessed troll!
